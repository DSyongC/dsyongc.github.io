Hi, there!

Welcome to my first blog named "YongC's Dev Garage"

This is the place for learning about development.

'Slow and Steady wins the race'

I like this phrase because I'm doing very slowly for anything, learning, exercises, reading, etc...
and also like the words that Nietzsche said,

"He who has a 'why' to live for can bear almost any 'how'" - Friedrich Nietzsche{:.notice}

My favorite language is Python because I have a interest in many fields of Data Science.

Web development using Django is another interest.

I'm not good at english but I hope to being bilanguial. so I try to write english as much as possible.


#Let's take a fantastic but little boring trip with me !
